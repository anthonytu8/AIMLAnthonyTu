#### Executive summary

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?
Fantasy football is a rapidly growing hobby. Additionally, it brings a lot of viewership to the NFL. Determining which platforms are best for preseason research is very valuable for success in fantasy football.

#### Research Question
What are you trying to answer?
What are the most important factors for predicting fantasy football success?
This was the original research question I was trying to answer. As I was began gathering and analyzing data, I realized this was too open ended. There are so many possible factors to consider.
So I've narrowed down the scope to which platforms rankings before the season starts actually have the most accurate rankings when compared to the actual results at the end of the season.
Here is my updated research question:
Which Fantasy Football platforms have the most accurate preseason rankings?

#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer you question?
Historical fantasy football ADP and weekly points data set found from Kaggle.

#### Methodology
What methods are you using to answer the question?
After cleaning and merging data into a single data frame, a sequential feature selector was run on multiple scoring styles and years of fantasy football.

Three different years were evaluated (2020, 2021, 2022) across three different scoring types (Half-PPR, Full-PPR, Standard).

#### Results
What did your research find?
Different platforms performed the best depending on scoring type and year. Scoring type was the more important factor in determining which platform performed the best, while things differed less year to year for the same scoring type.

For Standard scoring, MFL and FFC platforms had the best preseason rankings. For Full-PPR scoring, RTSports had the best preseason rankings. For Half-PPR scoring, FFC and Yahoo had the best preseason rankings.

#### Next steps
What suggestions do you have for next steps?
More years could be evaluated to strengthen the results. Additionally, now that his initial analysis has been done, we can widen the scope to other metrics besides preseason ADP.
