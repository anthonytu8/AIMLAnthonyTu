# Practical Application Assignment 17.1

Notebook with analysis - [https://github.com/anthonytu8/AIMLAnthonyTu/blob/main/CustomerCoupons/CustomerCoupons.ipynb](https://github.com/anthonytu8/AIMLAnthonyTu/blob/main/ComparingClassifiers/ComparingClassifiers.ipynb)

## Summary
The linked notebook above compares various models, specifically Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM. Diving deeper, Logistic Regression models with various features removed was also tested. For Decision Tree, multiple depths were tested. For KNN, multiple numbers of nearest neighbors were tested.

## Findings
Based on the observations, KNN model with 5 nearest neighbors performed the best.

## Recommendations
The KNN model with 5 nearest neighbors performed the best of the models analyzed. This is a great starting place for the selecting the best model.

## Next steps
For further tuning, more granular number of neighbors can be tried to optimize the KNN model even further.
