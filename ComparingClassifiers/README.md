# Practical Application Assignment 17.1

Notebook with analysis - https://github.com/anthonytu8/AIMLAnthonyTu/blob/main/CustomerCoupons/CustomerCoupons.ipynb

## Summary
The linked notebook above analyzes the provided customer coupon data, specifically diving deeper into bar coupons and coffee house coupons to examine which characteristics lead to higher acceptance rates for each type of coupon.

## Findings
Based on the observations, the following qualities had the most impact on higher acceptance rates of Bar coupons:
- More than 1 bar visit in a month
- Age under 30
- Having passengers who are not kids
- Income over $50K

Based on these observations, the following qualities lead to higher acceptance rates of Coffee House coupons:
- More than 1 coffee house visit in a month
- Morning time

## Recommendations
Send bar coupons to drivers who visit bars more than once a month, are under 30, have passengers who are not kids, and have income over $50K.

Send coffee house coupons to drivers who visit coffee houses more than once a month and are driving in the morning.

## Next steps
Divide the categories examined above even further. For example, frequency of bar visits can be divided even further. How much more likely are drivers who visit bars greater than 8 times to accept a bar coupon than those who visit less?

Do similar analysis on more categories from the available data to see what further characteristics and lead to higher acceptance rates.
